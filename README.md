# ticTacToeTOP

The Odin Project Tic Tac Toe Game project to practice Factory Functions and The Module Pattern.

- store gameboard as an array inside of a Gameboard object
- players are going to be stored in objects
- an object to control the flow of the game itself
- have as little global code as possible
- try to tucking everything away inside of a module or factory
- if we only ever need ONE of something (gameboard,displayController) then use a module
- if we need multiple of something (player!) then use factories
- setup HTML and write JS function that will render the contents of the game board array to the webpage (for now just manually fill in the array with 'x' and 'o')
- build the function that allow players to add marks to a specific spot on the board, and then tie it to the DOM
- letting players click on the gameboard to place their marker.
- Don't forget the logic that keeps players from playing in spots that are already taken
- Thing carefully about where each bit of logic should reside
- Each little piece of functionality should be able to fit in the game, player or game board objects
- Take care to put them in 'logical' places
- Build the logic that checks for when to game is over! Should check for 3-in-a-row and a tie
- Clean up the interface to allow players to put in their names, include a button to start/restart the game and add a display element that congratulates the winning player
- OPTIONAL - Create an AI so that a player can play against the computer if you are feeling ambitious!
- - Start by just getting the computer to make a random legal move
- - Once you've gotten that, work on making the computer smart. It is possible to create an unbeatable AI using the minimax algorithm
- - If we get this running definitely come show it off in the chatroom. It's quite accomplishment
